# Gmail Connection Testing Checklist

Use this checklist to systematically test and verify the Gmail OAuth connection.

---

## Pre-Flight Checklist ‚úàÔ∏è

Before you start testing, verify these are complete:

- [ ] **Google Cloud Console updated**
  - Redirect URI changed to: `https://bazeyxgsgodhnwckttxi.supabase.co/functions/v1/gmail-oauth-callback`
  - Changes saved
  - **Waited 10+ minutes** for propagation

- [ ] **Supabase Secrets verified**
  - FRONTEND_URL = `https://app.bliztic.com` (plain text, not hashed)
  - GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID matches your Google OAuth client
  - GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET matches your Google OAuth client
  - Functions redeployed after secret changes

- [ ] **Browser Setup**
  - Chrome/Firefox/Edge opened
  - Dev Tools open (F12)
  - Console tab visible
  - Network tab ready (optional, but helpful)

---

## Testing Phase 1: OAuth Initiation üöÄ

- [ ] Navigate to: https://app.bliztic.com/dashboard
- [ ] Confirm you're signed in (see your email in top-right)
- [ ] Locate "Connect Your Gmail" card (amber/yellow color)
- [ ] **Before clicking**, check console is ready to capture logs
- [ ] Click "Connect Gmail" button

**Expected Console Output:**
```
üîç Gmail OAuth Debug Info:
Client ID: 522566281733-ehke7sqmhla6suk6susnk5p7ok0d9kav.apps.googleusercontent.com
Supabase URL: https://bazeyxgsgodhnwckttxi.supabase.co
Redirect URI: https://bazeyxgsgodhnwckttxi.supabase.co/functions/v1/gmail-oauth-callback
User ID: [your-user-uuid]
```

- [ ] Console shows the above debug info
- [ ] Redirect URI includes `-callback` at the end
- [ ] Browser redirects to Google OAuth page

---

## Testing Phase 2: Google OAuth Consent üîê

- [ ] Google consent screen loads (accounts.google.com)
- [ ] App name shows: "Inbox Defender" (or your OAuth app name)
- [ ] Permissions requested show:
  - ‚úÖ Read, compose, send, and permanently delete mail from Gmail
  - ‚úÖ See your personal info, including any personal info you've made publicly available

- [ ] Select the Gmail account you want to connect
- [ ] Click "Allow" or "Continue"

**If you see an error here:**
- ‚ùå "redirect_uri_mismatch" ‚Üí Wait longer, or check Google Console URI again
- ‚ùå "access_denied" ‚Üí You clicked "Cancel", try again
- ‚ùå "invalid_client" ‚Üí Check GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID in Supabase secrets

---

## Testing Phase 3: OAuth Callback Processing ‚öôÔ∏è

After clicking "Allow", Google redirects back to your app.

**Expected URL Pattern:**
```
https://bazeyxgsgodhnwckttxi.supabase.co/functions/v1/gmail-oauth-callback?code=4%2F0AanReRp...&state=YOUR_USER_ID
```

- [ ] URL starts with `https://bazeyxgsgodhnwckttxi.supabase.co/functions/v1/gmail-oauth-callback`
- [ ] URL has `?code=` parameter
- [ ] URL has `&state=` parameter (your user ID)
- [ ] Page shows loading or processing indicator
- [ ] **Wait 5-10 seconds** for edge function to process

**Check Edge Function Logs (if needed):**
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/bazeyxgsgodhnwckttxi/functions
2. Click "gmail-oauth-callback"
3. View recent invocations
4. Should see logs like:
   ```
   === Gmail OAuth Callback Started ===
   Step 1: Exchanging authorization code for tokens...
   ‚úì Token exchange successful
   Step 2: Fetching Gmail user info...
   ‚úì User info fetched
   Step 3: Checking for existing mailbox...
   Step 4: Saving Gmail connection...
   ‚úì Gmail connection saved
   Step 5: Triggering initial sync...
   === OAuth Callback Completed Successfully ===
   ```

---

## Testing Phase 4: Redirect to Dashboard ‚úÖ

After edge function completes, you're redirected to dashboard.

**Expected URL:**
```
https://app.bliztic.com/dashboard?gmail_connected=true
```

- [ ] URL ends with `?gmail_connected=true`
- [ ] Green toast notification appears: "Gmail connected successfully! Syncing emails..."
- [ ] Gmail connection card changes from amber to **green**
- [ ] Card shows:
  - ‚úÖ "Gmail Connected" heading
  - ‚úÖ Your email address
  - ‚úÖ "is being monitored and protected"
  - ‚úÖ Last sync timestamp (may show "Never" initially)
  - ‚úÖ "Sync Now" button is enabled (not grayed out)
  - ‚úÖ "Disconnect" button visible

- [ ] All of the above are visible and correct
