CRITICAL FIX DEPLOYED:

Removed the dangerous auto-labeling code from gmail-sync-cron that was adding TRASH labels.

LINE 619 (OLD CODE - REMOVED):
  addLabelIds: ["TRASH"],

This was causing emails from repeat offenders to go directly to TRASH during manual sync.

NEW BEHAVIOR:
- Emails from blocked senders are marked as "blocked" in database
- They are sent to webhook-from-make for proper classification
- webhook-from-make has comprehensive TRASH protection safeguards
- No direct TRASH labeling anywhere in the codebase

The Edge Function needs to be manually redeployed via Supabase dashboard or CLI.
