# What Was Fixed - Quick Summary

## The Problem

Your emails were only syncing once (when you first connected Gmail) and never automatically syncing after that, even though the cron job was running every 15 minutes.

## The Root Cause

The database trigger function `trigger_gmail_sync()` was failing silently because it couldn't access the Supabase URL and API key it needed to call the edge function.

## The Solution

✅ **Fixed the trigger function** to use the correct Supabase credentials
✅ **Updated OAuth callback** to trigger immediate sync on first connection
✅ **Added infrastructure** for future real-time push notifications (Gmail API watches)
✅ **Enhanced dashboard** to show auto-sync status with visual indicators
✅ **Added automatic watch renewal** (runs every 6 days)

## What Happens Now

### ⏰ Every 15 Minutes Automatically

Your system will now check Gmail for new emails every 15 minutes without you having to do anything. The cron job runs in the background and:

1. Fetches new emails from Gmail
2. Stores them in your database
3. Sends them to Make.com for AI classification
4. Updates your dashboard in real-time

### 🔄 You Can See It Working

In your dashboard, you'll now see:
- A pulsing green dot showing "Auto-sync Active"
- "Last synced" timestamp updating every 15 minutes
- "Next auto-sync" countdown timer
- Informational message explaining how it works

### 🚀 Manual Sync Still Works

The "Sync Now" button lets you immediately check for new emails without waiting for the next scheduled sync.

## Test It Right Now

1. **Send yourself a test email** to jackson@bliztic.com
2. **Wait up to 15 minutes** (or click "Sync Now")
3. **Watch it appear** in your dashboard automatically

The next automatic sync will happen at the next 15-minute mark (e.g., 2:00, 2:15, 2:30, 2:45, etc.).

## Verification

To verify the cron is running, go to your Supabase dashboard > SQL Editor and run:

```sql
SELECT status, start_time, end_time
FROM cron.job_run_details
WHERE jobid = 2
ORDER BY start_time DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

You should see successful executions every 15 minutes.
